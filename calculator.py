#This program runs basic math calculations

#input number functions
#input first number
first_number = int(input("Provide your first number? "))
#input second number
second_number = int(input("Provide your second number? "))

# #addition
# sum = first_number + second_number
# print(f"The sum is:", sum)


# #subtraction
# difference = first_number - second_number
# print(f"The difference is:", difference)


# #multiplication
# product = first_number * second_number
# print(f"The product is:", product)


#division
result = first_number / second_number
print(f"The result is:", result)
